# Resume PDF Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file.

To create the actual PDF from the HTML resume:

1. Open the resume.html file in a browser
2. Press Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on Mac) to open print dialog
3. Select "Save as PDF" as destination
4. Save the file as "resume.pdf" in the public folder

Alternatively, you can use online tools or browser extensions to convert HTML to PDF.

The resume.html file is already styled for print with proper margins and formatting.
